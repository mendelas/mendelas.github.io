bio: |
  Kota is a SLAM and radio sensing specialist working on Physical AI—building autonomous systems that can perceive, communicate, and navigate in the real world. His research bridges SLAM and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), integrating wireless measurements with robotic perception to achieve robust localization and mapping in challenging, low-feature environments. He combines wireless signal processing with probabilistic state estimation to make SLAM radio-aware and communication sensing-capable.
